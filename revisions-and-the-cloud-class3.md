The purpose of Git is to be able to store versions of your code in a safe way online. Its essential to be able to have copies of code to save your work amd also for other programmers to be able to collaborate on projects together. Git allows for what is called "non-linear" development which means that many people can work on it at once so it supports large projects.

When working with Git for the first time, its important that you must first configure the Git settings. This has already been done on my machine, but the codes are `git config --global user.name "Jane Smith"` and `git config --global user.email "example@email.com"`. You should now be ready to import a project into Git. To do this make sure you're in the right directory by typing `cd test` and then create a subdirectory called `git init`. Now you're ready to use Git! The first thing you'll do next is use the clone command which creates a copy of your existing Git repository from GitHub, use the clone command like this: `git clone https://github.com/test`. After this you are free to make all the changes you want to your repository. It's important to know when its time to commit changes to your file after making edits. You can always get the status of your Git file by using `git status`. You should commit changes to your code when using Git frequently and also add a note whenever you commit like: `git commit -m "made change x,y,z"`. After this its time to apply those changes with `git push origin master` which means your changes will be live on your site.
