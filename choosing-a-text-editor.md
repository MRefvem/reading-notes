Certain text editors will help you write more code more efficiently. 
Choose one that has nice features like plugins to make coding easier.
A couple different popular plugins include syntax highlighters and code completion.
You’ll also want to choose a text editor with a nice theme to help reduce the strain on the eyes over time.
It’s worth doing a little bit of research into different text editors to use.
While you can use the one that comes stock on your computer, 
these are usually the most barebones examples and don’t come with features that makes coding easier and more efficient in the end.

Some good premium text editors to choose from include NotePad++, BB Edit, Visual Studio Code, Atom, Brackets, and Sublime Text.
Another class of text editors include IDEs, or Integrated Development Environments. 
These are more robust suites of integrated softwares that try to combine as many elements of text editing, 
file managing, compilers and debuggers all into the same package.
While it might seem nice to have access to all of these features in the same package, 
its certainly not necessary and even more than you’ll need getting started in web development. 
Many experienced developers stick to the more basic text editors.

Using the Command Line –
A command line is an extra tool computer programmers use to do work in addition to the normal GUI (Graphical User Interface). 
It can be really helpful to have one or multiple command lines open when doing heavy duty work.
