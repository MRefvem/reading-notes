## Computer Architecture and Logic

### Foundations of Computer Architecture

What is a computer? Computers are information machines. It turns out that while there are many different types of computers in today's world, they are all similar in a basic level in that they are all capable of doing the same four basic functions:

- Receiving Input: Telling a computer what to do
- Storage: Information is storred in memory using algorithm that pushes it back and forth between storage and processing, a sort of "idle flow pattern"
- Processing
- Output: The info that comes out

### Data and Binary

Computers work in binary. A bunch of 1's and 0's. Storing information through electricity. 1 represents an "on" signal and 0 represents "off".  Decimal number system vs. Binary system, computers end up doing the calculations for us as thats the basic function they're designed to do. You can represent any number you like in binary, as well as text, images, and sound too. Words and paragraphs are turned into sequences of numbers. Pixels have colors that are represented by numbers. Sounds can be represented as a wave form on a graph, and that can be translated into numerical values too.

### Circuits and Logic

Every input and output is a type of information. Computers combine these signals into a circuit. A simple circuit takes a 0 and turns it into a 1, and vice versa. The circuits are combined to be able to form complex calculations. Smaller circuits are faster at performing calculations because even though electricity is fast, it can travel between them faster.

### Memory, CPU, Input and Output

The computer runs thousands of processes when you type a single letter.Computers that do complicated things need more CPUs and Memory.

### Hardware and Software

Hardware and Software interact with the CPU: the Master Chip that controls all the aspects of the computer. It knows which circuit to use to do a specific job. Creating a sequence of commands. Python, Ruby and other codes help us write Binary code very quickly. The Operating System is the Master Program that Manages the computer, the master software. It lets you install programs, how the programs are run, whether the program can access the input and output systems. Operating Systems manage Software. Software gives us the power to build things that matter to us and the world.
