### Duckett HTML & CSS Chapter 2: "Text"

Structural markup vs. Semantic markup:

- Structural markup: the elements that you can use to describe both headings and paragraphs.
- Semantic markup: which provides extra information; such as where emphasis is placed in a sentence, that something you have written is a quotation (and who said it), the meaning of acronyms, and so on.

#### Structural Markup

Headings. HTML has six "levels" of headings:

`<h1>` is used for main headings
`<h2>` is used for subheadings
`<h3>` through `<h6>` is used for further sections under the subheadings

To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening `<p>` tag and closing `</p>` tag.

Bold & Italic
`<b>` and `<i>`

Superscript & Subscript
`<sup>` and `<sub>`

White Space. Web browsers display large spaces of white as only a single space.

Line breaks and horizontal rules. If you cant to add a line break inside the middle of a paragraph you can use the line break tag `<br />`
You can add a horizontal rule to draw a line between sections with `<hr />`
These two are called "empty elements" and are written with only one tag.

Visual editors & their code views. Content management systems and HTML editors such as Dreamweaver usually have two views of the page you are creating: a visual editor and a code view.

#### Semantic Markup.

There are some text elements that are not intended to affect the structure of your web pages, but they do add extra information to the pages - they are known as semantic markup.

Strong and Emphasis. `<strong>` indicates that the text is meant to be said strongly and `<em>` is meant to indicate that there is a special emphasis that changes the sentence meaning.

Quotations. There are two elements commonly used for marking up quotations: `<blockquote>` and `<q>`. Use `<blockquote>` for multi-line bigger quotes and `<q>` for quotes that exist within a sentence.

Abbreviations and acronyms use the same tab: `<abbr>`. Use this to highlight an acronym and a text box will give you its full form.

Citations and Definitions. When you are referencing a piece of work such as a book, film or research paper, use the `<cite>` element. Browsers will render the comment in italics. When referencing a big concept for the first time in a document, you should use the `<dfn>` tag to bookmark where the definition takes place.

Author details. `<address>` used to display the author's email or physical adress or phone number on the page. Defaults to italics.

Changes to content. `<ins>` `<del>` used to show where you've made changes in a document. Strikethrough element `<s>` is used to draw a line through words that are no longer important.
