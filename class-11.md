# Class 11 Reading Notes

### Duckett HTML & CSS Chapter 16: "Images"

Summary Images
- You can specify the dimensions of images using CSS. This is very helpful when you use the same sized images on several pages of your site.
- Images can be aligned both horizontally and vertically using CSS.
- You can use a background image behind the box created by any element on a page.
- Background images can appear just once or be repeated across the background of the box.
- You can create image rollover effects by moving the background position of an image.
- To reduce the number of images your browser has to load, you can create image sprites.


### Duckett HTML & CSS Chapter 19: "Practical Information"

Summary Practical Information
- Search engine optimization helps visitors find your sites when using search engines.
- Analytics tools such as Google Analytics allow you to see how many people visit your site, how they find it, and what they do when they get there.
- To put your site on the web, you will need to obtain a domain name and web hosting.
- FTP programs allow you to transfer files from your local computer to your web server.
- Many companies provide platforms for blogging, email newsletters, e-commerce and other popular website tools (to save you writing them from scratch).


### Duckett HTML & CSS Chapter 9: Flash

Flash is a very popular technology used to add animations, video, and audio to websites. Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites. Since 2005, a number of factors have meant that fewer websites are written in Flash or even use elements of Flash in their pages.
- In 2005-6, a set of JavaScript libraries were launched (including Prototype, script.aculo.us, and JQuery) which made it easier for people to create animated effects using JavaScript.
- When Apple launched the iPhone in 2007 and later the iPad in 2010, they took the decision not to support Flash.
- There have been laws introduced to ensure that websites are usable by those with visual or physical impairments - and Flash has been criticized because Flash does not always meet accessibility requirements.
- In 2008, browsers started to support HTML5 `<video>` and `<audio>` tags. At the time of writing, Flash is still a popular way of playing video and audio on the web but more and more people are switching to HTML5.
