### Dynamic web pages with JavaScript Reflection

This was a really cool exercise we did with the book. We were able to use JavaScript to get a webpage to behave differently depending on the time of day. It was my first time using JavaScript and I definitely can see how useful it can be. Can't wait to learn more!

I definitely had a good sense of accomplishment getting some basic JavaScript to work in my webpage!
