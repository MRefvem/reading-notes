## My review

I feel like I am beginning to understand Unit Testing a lot better than the beginning of the week. This concept of writing tests was really foreign to me when I first started. Everything from learning the exact syntact, the execution and implementation of the tests was weird and on top of that also learning the new workflow of doing things in Visual Studio was really hard at first. I think things are finally starting to come along and I can only assume that creating tests will be like second nature to me in the coming weeks.
