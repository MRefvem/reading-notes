## Linked Lists

Linked List: an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor.

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations. The elements in a linked list are linked using pointers. In simple words, a linked list consists of nodes where each node contains a data field and a reference(link) to the next node in the list.

The disadvantages of using a linked list are: they use more memory than arrays because of the storage used by their pointers. Difficulties arise in linked lists when it comes to reverse traversing.

Advantages of linked lists over arrays are: size of the list doesn't need to be mentioned at the beginning of the program, certainly dynamic memory allocation and deallocation. As the linked list doesn't have a size limit, we can go on adding new nodes and increasing the size of the list to any extent.

A linked list is known as a dynamic data structure because it can be used with a data collection that grows and shrinks during program implementation.
