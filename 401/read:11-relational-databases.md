## Tutorials Point: DBMS - Overview

Database is a collection of related data and data is a collection of facts and figures that can be processed to produce information.

Mostly data represents recordable facts. Data aids in producing information, which is based on facts. For example, if we have data about marks obtained by all students, we can then conclude about toppers and average marks.

A database management system stores data in such a way that it becomes easier to retrieve manipulate and process information.

### Characteristics
Research was done to make sure DBMS overcomes the deficiencies of a traditional style of data management.
- Real-world entity
- Relation-based tables - DBMS allows entities and relations among them to form tables. A user can understand the architecture of a database just by looking at the table names.
- Isolation of data and application
- Less redundancy
- Consistency
- Query Language
- ACID Properties - Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability
- Multiuser and Concurrent Access
- Multiple views
- Security

### Users
A typical DBMS has users with different rights and permissions who use it for different purposes. Some users retrieve data and some back it up.

- Administrators - Administrators maintain the DBMS and are responsible for administrating the database.
- Designers - Designers are the group of people who actually work on designing part of the database.
- End Users - End users are those who actually reap the benefits of having a DBMS.
