# Read: Class 26 - Bootstrap and MVC

Bootstrap is a way to quickly design and customize responsive mobile-first sites. It's the world's most popular front-end open source toolkit, featuring Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components and powerful JavaScript plugins.

Bootstrap is based on the grid system and filled with prebuilt components. It makes building a front end super super easy and gives you a starting point towards building more complicated front ends too. The main reason people use bootstrap is for the repsonsive grid system. The columns must add up to 12. Bootstrap makes it really easy to calibrate your webdesign for different sized viewports.

Navbars are a staple of bootstrap. In order to toggle the navbar properties you want to control, you set classes to the nav divs. What makes bootstrap classes interesting is that you add the CSS properties in a string of text there. You don't need to actually modify any of you divs in a CSS style sheet. Modals, forms, lists and cards are also made a lot easier in bootstrap.
