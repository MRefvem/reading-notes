## Game: CSS Grid Garden

Played the fun game CSS Grid Garden where you interact with a virtual garden, watering plants and removing weeds, using the CSS `grid-column` property. Unfortunately, I came across a bug in their programming that never allowed me to make it past problem 10 of 28. Game glitched out every single time I tried to solve this problem. But I will say that I learned quite a bit about this new function having had to repeat the first 9 four times.
