# Read:03 - Flexbox and Templating

## Templating with Mustache
JavaScript templating is a fast and efficient technique to render client-side view templates with JavaScript by using a JSON data source. The template is HTML markup, with added templating tags that will either insert variables or run programming logic.

Mustache is a logic-less template syntax. It can be used for HTML, config files, source code - anything. It works by expanding togs in a template using values provided in a hash or object.

It is often referred to as "logic-less" because there are no if statements, else clauses, or for loops. Instead, there are only tags. Some tags are replaced with a value, some nothing, and others a series of values.
