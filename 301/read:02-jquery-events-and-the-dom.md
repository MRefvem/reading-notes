# Read:02 - jQuery, Events, and the DOM

jQuery offers a simple way to achieve a variety of common JavaScript tasks quickly and consistently, across all major browsers and without any fallback code needed.
- Select Elements: It is simpler to access elements using jQuery's CSS-style selectors than it is using DOM queries. The selectors are also more powerful and flexible.
- Perform Tasks: jQuery's methods let you update the DOM tree, animate elements into and out of view, and loop through a set of elements, all in one line of code.
- Handle Events: jQuery includes methods that allow you to attach event listeners to selected elements without having to write any fallback code to support older browsers.

What is jQuery? jQuery is a JavaScript file that you include in your web pages. It lets you find elements using CSS-style selectors and then do something with the elements using jQuery methods.

`$()` serves as the shorthand for the function `jQuery()`.

Similarities to DOM
- jQuery selectors perform a similar task to traditional DOM queries, but the syntax is much simpler.
- You can store the jQuery object in a variable, just as you can with DOM nodes.
- You can use jQuery methods and properties (like DOM methods and properties) to manipulate the DOM nodes that you select.

Why Use jQuery? jQuery doesn't do anything you cannot achieve with pure JavaScript. It is just a JavaScript file but estimates show it has been used on over a quarter of the sites on the web, because it makes coding simpler.

jQuery's motto is "Write less, do more," because it allows you to achieve the same goals but in fewer lines of code than you would need to write with plan JavaScript.

## Allie Grampa: 6 Reasons for Pair Programming (Article)
[www.codefellows.org](https://www.codefellows.org/blog/6-reasons-for-pair-programming/)

Pair programming is the practice of two developers sharing a single workstation to interactively tackle a coding task together.

Pair programming commonly involves two roles: the Driver and the Navigator. The Driver is the programmer who is typing and the only one whose hands are on the keyboard. Handling the "mechanics" of coding, the Driver manages the text editor, switching files, version control, and writing code. The Navigator thinks about the big picture, what comes next, how an algorithm might be converted in to code, while scanning for typos or bugs. The Navigator might also utilize their computer as a second screen to look up solutions and documentation, but should not be writing any code.

Benefits offered by practicing pair programming:

- Greater efficiency: When two people focus on the same code base, it is easier to catch mistakes in the making. Pairing also enhances technical skills, team communication, and even enjoyability of coding in the workplace.

- Engaged collaboration: When two programmers focus on the same code, the experience is more engaging and both programmers are more focused than if they were working alone. It is harder to procrastinate or get off track when someone else is relying on you to complete the work.

- Learning from fellow students: Working with a teammate can expose developers to techniques they otherwise would not have thought of. Often times, the developers in a pairing have different skill sets. If one programmer is more experienced in a certain skill, they can teach a student who is less familiar with that area.

- Social skills: When working with someone who has a different coding style, communication is key.  Pair programming not only improves programming skills, but can also help programmers develop their interpersonal.

- Job interview readiness: A common step in many interview processes involves pair programming between a current employee and an applicant, either in person or through a shared screen. They will carry out exercises together, such as code challenges, building a project or feature, or debugging an existing code base. By doing so, companies can get a better feel for how an applicant will fit into the team and their collaboration style.

- Work environment readiness: Many companies that utilize pair programming expect to train fresh hires from CS-degree programs on how they operate to actually deliver a product. Code Fellows graduates who are already familiar with how pairing works can hit the ground running at a new job, with one less hurdle to overcome.
