## Ryan Tomayko: "A Conversation about REST with my brother" (Article)

Article about Roy Fielding, one of the founders of the internet, he wrote some of the first web servers that sent documents across the internet. He was the inventor of HTTP. It turns out HTTP was one of the most important breakthroughs in the history of computing because it is capable of describing the location of something anywhere in the world from anywhere in the world. The foundation of the web, its like GPS coordinates for knowledge and information.

The World Wide Web is build on an architectural style called "REST". REST provides a definition of a resource. A web page is a representation of a resource. URLs tell the browser that there is a concept somewhere and then a browser can go ask for a specific representation of the concept.

Theres a concept called "Web Services" or "APIs". It basically means machines can access the web just like people do. Computers can use the same protocols to send messages back and forth to eachother that people do. We need to be able to talk to all machines and a way of having one machine tell another machine about a resource that might be on yet another machine. A concept known as a "redirect".

URLs are so important because with so many different types of programming languages and operating systems available, it is one of the only ways for all computers to recognize a reference.

The HTTP-this protocol Fielding and his friends created is all about applying verbs to nouns. For instance, when you go to a web page, the browser does an HTTP GET on the URL you type in a back comes a web page. The HTTP GET protocol is applyed to all things that make up a webpage: images, text, video, mp3, slideshows, etc.

HTTP in itself is not about getting URLs, but it is actually a general purpose protocol for applying verbs and nouns.
