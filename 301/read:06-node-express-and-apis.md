### What is Node.js?
- "Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine."
- "Node.js is an event-based, non-blocking, asynchronous I/O runtime that uses Google's V8 JavaScript engine and libuv library."

### Node is built on Google Chrome's V8 JavaScript Engine
The V8 engine is the open-source JavaScript engine that runs in Google Chrome and other Chromium-based web browsers, including Brave, Opera, and Vivaldi. It was designed with performance in mind and is responsible for compiling JavaScript directly to native machine code that your computer can execute. Node.js is a program we can use to execute JavaScript on our computers. In other words, it is a JavaScript runtime.

### Introducing npm, the JavaScript Package Manager
Node comes bundled with a package manager called npm. In addition to being the package manager for JavaScript, npm is also the world's largest software registry. There are over 1,000,000 packages of JavaScript code available to download, with billions of downloads per week.
